<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Modern technology has been a gateway to executing my love for helping, teaching and interacting with human beings. 
  This melding has allowed me to pursue, learn and experience a wide array of technologies, starting from my early years 
  as an apprentice electrician, computer technician, network technician to now being and becoming a data engineer and 
  database administrator. </p>

<p>Using the accumulation of all my technological experiences (to find, recommend, develop, test, implement, maintain and teach) 
  to fully deploy solutions for real world problems and observing their impact is a dream come true.</p>
